A Shopify store is essentially a website, so having a solid foundation in web development is crucial. This involves learning three key skills:
- **HTML**: The structure of web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling and visual design.
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity and dynamic features.

### How to Get Started
To quickly grasp these basics:
- Visit the **Free Code Camp** YouTube channel and take their free courses on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Explore resources like **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)** and **W3Schools** for in-depth tutorials.

#### Pro Tip:
Test your learning by replicating projects from tutorials and adding your own features. For example:
- Follow a tutorial on creating a product page, then add customizations like filters, animations, or new layouts.

## 3. Shopify App Development and the Shopify API
Once you’re comfortable with Shopify theme development, take your skills further by learning Shopify App Development.

### What is Shopify App Development?
Shopify App Development involves creating apps to extend the functionality of Shopify stores. It requires knowledge of backend development and working with the Shopify API.

### Steps to Learn Shopify App Development
1. **Learn Backend Development**:
   - Use **Free Code Camp** to learn backend basics.
   - Start with **Node.js** if you know JavaScript, or explore **Python** or **Ruby** as beginner-friendly alternatives.

   #### Pro Tip:
   The language doesn’t matter as much as your ability to build useful solutions. Choose one that feels intuitive to you.

2. **Understand the Shopify API**:
   - Learn how the Shopify authentication (auth) process works.
   - Avoid using pre-built app development templates; build your own auth process to truly understand it.

3. **Practice**:
   - Build a few simple Shopify apps.
   - Analyze existing Shopify apps and replicate their functionality to solidify your understanding.

Focus on understanding the fundamentals of how the auth process works. It’s challenging, but mastering it will make your skills versatile.
